## Bitcoin Market Analysis

*Figure 1: Distribution of Bitcoin holders across different address sizes.*

Bitcoin ownership is widespread but often distributed across smaller addresses, with 80.35% of holders having less than $1,000 in Bitcoin. Despite this, whale holders (addresses holding large amounts) control 1.26% of addresses but hold a significant portion of the total supply. This dynamic allows whales to have outsized market influence.

#### Key Insights:
- Majority of addresses hold small amounts of Bitcoin.
- Whale addresses, though fewer in number, have a substantial market influence.
- Long-term holding is dominant, with 70.89% of addresses showing consistent accumulation.

### 2. Cold and Hot Wallets - Bitcoin Holder Insights
According to [Arkham Intelligence](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/token/bitcoin), the top Bitcoin holders are primarily cold wallets, often associated with exchanges or institutional investors. Hot wallets, which are frequently used for trading and transactions, represent a smaller share but handle a higher volume of transfers.

#### Key Holders:
- **Cold Wallets**: Secure long-term storage, typically owned by exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. These wallets hold massive amounts of Bitcoin and rarely move funds, signifying long-term confidence.
- **Hot Wallets**: More frequently used for transactions, generally controlled by exchanges or active traders. They hold a smaller share but have higher transaction volume.
