# **Altcoin Market Analysis**

## **1. Introduction to Altcoins**
Altcoins, or alternative coins, refer to all cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin. These digital assets have emerged to improve upon the limitations of Bitcoin or to serve different use cases, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, NFTs, and more. While Bitcoin was created primarily as a decentralized store of value, altcoins offer a wider variety of functions, from smart contracts to stablecoins designed to minimize volatility.

Common categories of altcoins include:
- **Utility Tokens**: Serve specific functions within a platform (e.g., Ethereum’s Ether for gas fees).
- **Security Tokens**: Digital assets representing ownership of real-world assets like stocks.
- **Stablecoins**: Pegged to stable assets like the US dollar (e.g., USDT, USDC).
- **Meme Coins**: Created as a joke or for fun but gaining traction due to community interest (e.g., Dogecoin).
